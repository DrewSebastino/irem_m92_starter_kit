There are a number of programs that first need to be downloaded and placed
in this directory in order for the batch file to operate correctly:
	1. yasm:	http://yasm.tortall.net/Download.html
	2. romwak:	https://github.com/freem/romwak/releases
	3. 7z:		https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

I would also recommend downloading yychr for modifying both .chr files.

In addition, the batch file needs to be modified to include your MAME
roms directory, your MAME directory, and optionally, this directory.
